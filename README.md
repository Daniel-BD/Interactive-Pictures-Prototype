# Interactive-Pictures-Prototype
 A simple app used as a prototype in a course about 'tangible interactions'. The idea is to have pictures in your home start to fade away when you don't interact with them for long stretches of time, and in order to get them to 'fade back', you have the grab the picture and shake it (like what people did with Polaroid pictures).
