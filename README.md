# Interactive Pictures Prototype
 A simple app used as a prototype in a course about 'tangible interactions'. The idea is to have pictures in your home start to fade away when you don't interact with them for long stretches of time, and in order to get them to 'fade back', you have the grab the picture and shake it (like what people did with Polaroid pictures). Once the image is fully faded in again, a soothing sound plays, and the phone vibrates in the pattern of a heartbeat. 
 
* When the user shakes the phone, the picture slowly fades in
* The slider adjusts how fast the picture fades in when shaking the phone
* You can change the background from black to white with the icon button (used to evaluate if there was a difference in users experience depending on the background color)
* The switch will turn on/off vibrations, that happens once the picture is fully faded in
